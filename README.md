# SyntheticNetflowEvaluation

This repository contains all the metrics of the paper A Tale of Two Methods: Unveiling the limitations of GAN and the Rise of Bayesian Networks for Synthetic Network Traffic Generation presented at WTMC 2024

To run them on your netflows, you first need to install requirements.txt in your virtual environment. Both your real netflows and your synthetic netflows should be stored in a pandas dataframe. Some functions will take your discrete features as input, others only your numerical features, and other both. Please refer to the paper for more details.

We do not hold any right to any of these functions or metrics; for some, they were invented long before any member of our team walked this earth and they are widely used everywhere, so use them at your convenience and refer their initial authors in your works (see paper for the different references) ;)

A more in-depth tutorial is under preparation, leave a star and be prepared.
